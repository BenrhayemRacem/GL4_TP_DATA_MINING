# About 

This repository represents an academic workshop of `data mining` course. It contains a practical assignment to get in depth with both supervised and unsupervised learning.

# Supervised learning :

The objectives learnt are :
- Visualizing the dataset
- Using `naive bayes` model and learning its prinicples
- Implementing a method that splits dataset into training and test datasets ( A manual implementation of  sklearn `train_test_split` function ) 
- Training the model using different training dataset size
- Calculating errors and scores in each case
- Cross validation 
- Using `Random Forest` model

# Unsupervised learning :

The objectives learnt are :
- Visualizing the dataset
- Using `kmeans` model and learning its prinicples
- Calculating the `silhouette score`
- Drawing the `dendrogram` with hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm (HAC)
- Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Using an Agglomerative Clustering (AGNES) and drawing its dendrogram
- Comparing HAC and Agglomerative Clustering results with the kmeans using crosstab
- Implementing a manual DIANA ( DIvisie ANAlysis) approach based on kmeans
